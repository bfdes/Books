```scheme
(define (fold-left op initial sequence)
    (define (iter result rest)
        (if (null? rest)
            result
            (iter (op result (car rest)) (cdr rest))))
    (iter initial sequence))
```

```scheme
(define (fold-right op initial sequence)
  (if (null? sequence)
      initial
      (op (car sequence)
          (fold-right op 
                      initial 
                      (cdr sequence)))))
```

- `(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))` becomes 1 / (2 / 3) or `3/2`
- `(fold-left  / 1 (list 1 2 3))` becomes (1 / 2) / 3 or `1/6`
- `(fold-right list '() (list 1 2 3))` is `(1 (2 (3 ())))`
- `(fold-left  list '() (list 1 2 3))` is `(((() 1) 2) 3)`

`op` must be associative for the result to be the same (for any sequence).
